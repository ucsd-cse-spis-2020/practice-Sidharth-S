# practice-Sidharth-S


Hi my name is Sidharth and I am an incoming Math-CS freshman to Warren College. I am very interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence and my goals from this program
are to achieve a level of programming prpficiency that allows me to develop more complex and real-world applicable programs as well as to find a niche/club/research group in UCSD 
can cater to my ambitions. Some of my other hobbies include playing the guitar, basketball, and video games.
